# MBN staking frontend

This is an interface for testing implementation of MBN staking smart contract which can be found [here](https://github.com/wamfever/erc20-staking-test).

##Description
This project is a fork of https://github.com/wamfever/erc721-dapp-test
I decided to reuse code from Alex test due to his implementation of generic forms.

##Interface
The project interface allows for calling approve on ERC20 contract and stake tokens on Staking Contract.

## Running locally
### On the existing contract
1. ``npm install``
2. ``npm start``
